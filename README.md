Random Name Generator
====================

This is a silly little library for generating real-ish names. By real, I mean things like: 

	Paul Jones
	Deidre Smith
	Kevin Toast
	Deidre Yaris
	Terry Gravel
	Kelly Jones
	Naeem Trains
	Kate Trains
	Steve Jonesford
	Rebecca Steve
	Barry Twerp
	Kelly Smith
	Gavin Toastson
	Rebecca Yaris
	Derek Gravisham
	Natalie Steve
	Alan Evans
	Deidre Rogerston
	Kevin Gravis
	Rebecca Magnetsson
	
It's for a game that needs everyone to have names. If you want to extend the current English-ish
name generator, or want to contribute a different generator, feel free to fork. The generator API
gives access to the mother and father names, so it could generate matronymics and patronymics.
